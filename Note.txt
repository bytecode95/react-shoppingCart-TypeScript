JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format. 
It is easy for humans to read and write, and it is easy for machines to parse and generate. 
JSON is a text format that is completely language-independent but uses conventions familiar to programmers of the C family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.
